.TH gitsync 1 "July 20 2010" "Daniel Blaschke"
.SH NAME
gitsync \- A commit and push script for easy using git
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gitsync
.BR [-m " 'commit Message' " -f " 'Files to add' /location/of/repository " -h/--help]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
GitSync is a shell script designed to simplify the usage of the version control 
system GIT (see www.git-scm.com for more information) for people who don't want 
to worry about several commands (such as git-add, git-commit, git-pull and 
git-push) all the time, but "just want to synchronize" their repository.
.PP
Of course, when using GitSync, you are not as flexible as with the separate git 
commands in the sense that GitSync always commits/syncs everything (apart from 
the exceptions defined in the file ".gitignore", and unless the option -f is 
used as explained below).
Therefore, GitSync does not replace git-commit, etc., but is meant to "complete"
the set of commands by providing a "do everything to sync my repository" 
command.
.SH OPTIONS
All parameters are optional, i.e. when the -m option is omitted, you are asked 
for a commit message later in the script. (Depending on the configuration of
USE_EDITOR as mentioned below, a text editor is opened for this purpose.)
If the -f option is omitted, everything will be synced. (Otherwise, only the 
list of files/folders provided with that option will be considered).
If the location/of/repository parameter (which is always the last!) is omitted, 
the present folder is assumed to contain the repository (i.e. the location ".").
.SS CONFIGURATION
The script offers several options defined by configuration variables. Their default values 
can be overridden by creating a GitSync-configuration file "gitsync.conf" 
directly in your repository folder, i.e. the one containing the sub-folder 
".git".
Alternatively - or additionally - you may also create a file ".gitsync.conf" 
in your home-directory, which will be parsed before the other one.
.PP
Syntax of gitsync.conf (as shown in the sample file GitSync/examples/gitsync.conf):
VARIABLE_NAME value
(Comments are ignored, and for compatibility with future versions should start 
with #).
.PP
The following variables - default values are on the left hand side - may be 
adjusted to your needs:
.TP
GIT_SERVER="auto" .......................... Change to "yes" or "no" 
if you want to override auto-detection, i.e. "no" if you don't have a git server and only want to use git locally. (GitSync will then omit the calls "git pull" and "git push".) Note, that if nothing has changed locally, GitSync will still call "git pull" to download the latest version from your git server, if GIT_SERVER="yes".
.TP
USE_EDITOR="no" .......................... Change to "yes" if you 
would like to use a text editor for providing git-commit comments. Optionally, "yes" can also be replaced by the name of your favourite editor to use instead of your systems default.
Additionally, it is also possible to provide a comment as an optional argument when calling the script: For example, you may use the command
gitsync -m 'this is a comment'
which then passes your comment on to git-commit. (When merely calling "gitsync" you are asked to provide a comment during runtime.)
.TP
GIT_DIR=".git" .......................... Only change if you invoked 
the "git init" command with the $GIT_DIR environment variable of git set to something else than the default.
.TP
CUSTOM_START_SCRIPT="" ................... Change to the name of a 
custom script that you would like to call before the actual syncing with GitSync. The variable may contain an absolute path, or a path relative to the location of your git repository. (Note that currently no arguments can be passed to the custom script, i.e. no blanks allowed in this variable.)
.TP
CUSTOM_END_SCRIPT="" ..................... Change to the name of a 
custom script that you would like to call after the actual syncing with GitSync. The variable may contain an absolute path, or a path relative to the location of your git repository. (Note that currently no arguments can be passed to the custom script, i.e. no blanks allowed in this variable.)
