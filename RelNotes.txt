GitSync Release Notes
=====================

Changes from version 1.2.2 to version 1.2.3:
---------------------------------------------
.) added optional call to git-gc --auto (automatic "garbage clean") after 
   committing; this is controlled by the new variable 'GARBAGE_COLLECT' as
   described in the README file
.) minor code cleanup/improvements


Changes from version 1.2.1 to version 1.2.2:
---------------------------------------------
.) added support for absolute path names in custom start/end scripts
   (previously only paths relative to the git repository)
.) custom script names now must be at least 3 letters long
.) warning message now displayed when gitsync is called by root
.) small corrections/amendments to documentation


Changes from version 1.2.0 to version 1.2.1:
---------------------------------------------
.) gitsync -h/--help now displays usage-info
.) invalid command line options now trigger error-message instead of being 
   silently ignored
.) added support for commenting out valid entries in "gitsync.conf" using "#"
.) cleanup of gitsync-output
.) created manpage (based on README-file) for Linux/Unix, and added install-
   instructions to README-file
.) if 'git commit' aborts, 'git add' is now undone automatically by calling
   'git reset -q'


Changes from version 1.1.1 to version 1.2.0:
---------------------------------------------
.) new command line syntax:
   gitsync [-m 'commit Message' -f 'Files to add' /location/of/repository]
   (The default behaviour when omitting options is: "gitsync -f . .")
.) GitSync can now be used to add/commit only certain files (or subfolders)
   (-f option)
.) GIT_REP-variable deprecated: replaced by command line argument
.) added support for custom configuration file
   "gitsync.conf" for overriding options of GitSync
.) new optional variables CUSTOM_START_SCRIPT and 
   CUSTOM_END_SCRIPT for calling custom scripts before 
   and/or after syncing
.) new option: USE_EDITOR="name-of-editor" (in addition to 
   "no" and "yes", where the systems default editor is used)
.) some minor optimizations and checks (e.g. for existing
   git command)
.) included examples for gitsync.conf and custom scripts, 
   and updated README-file


Changes from version 1.1.0 to version 1.1.1:
---------------------------------------------
.) enhanced compatibility: made the script also work with 
   dash (previously only bash)


Changes from version 1.0.1 to version 1.1.0:
---------------------------------------------
.) New default option GIT_SERVER="auto": searches the file 
   .git/config for a configured git-server (i.e. remote 
   repository) in order to determine whether pull/push are 
   necessary. (Nonetheless, the GIT_SERVER-options "yes" 
   and "no" are still valid and will override the check above.)
.) minor bugfix
.) README-file updated accordingly


Changes from version 1.0.0 to version 1.0.1:
---------------------------------------------
.) When $GIT_SERVER is set to "yes", gitsync now always tries 
   to push to the server (even if nothing is to be committed), 
   so that if the network connection breaks down during a 
   commit/push, another call of gitsync will continue the job.
