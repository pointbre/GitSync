HOW TO USE GITSYNC
------------------------------------------

GitSync is a shell script designed to simplify the usage of the version control 
system GIT (see www.git-scm.com for more information) for people who don't want 
to worry about several commands (such as git-add, git-commit, git-pull and 
git-push) all the time, but "just want to synchronize" their repository.

Of course, when using GitSync, you are not as flexible as with the separate git 
commands in the sense that GitSync always commits/syncs everything (apart from 
the exceptions defined in the file ".gitignore"). Therefore GitSync does not 
replace git-commit, etc., but is meant to  "complete" the set of commands by 
providing a "do everything to sync my repository" command.

The script offers several options collected in the section "# OPTIONS:". Change 
the following variables to adjust to your needs:

GIT_SERVER="yes" .......................... Change to "no" if you don't have a 
                        git server and only want to use git locally. (GitSync 
                        will then omit the calls "git pull" and "git push".)
                        Note, that if nothing has changed locally, GitSync will 
                        still call "git pull" to download the latest version 
                        from your git server, if GIT_SERVER="yes".

USE_EDITOR="no" .......................... Change to "yes" if you would like to 
                        use a text editor for providing git-commit comments. 
                        (Uncomment and change the section 
                        "# export EDITOR=emacs" 
                        in the script to use a different editor than your 
                        systems default.)
                        Additionally, it is also possible to provide a comment 
                        as an optional argument when calling the script: For 
                        example, you may use the command
                        $ ./gitsync 'this is a comment'
                        which then passes your comment on to git-commit. (When 
                        merely calling "$ ./gitsync" you are asked to provide 
                        a comment during runtime.)
                        

GIT_DIR=".git" .......................... Only change if you invoked the 
                        "git init" command with the $GIT_DIR environment 
                        variable of git set to something else than the default.

GIT_REP="." ............................ Change this variable if you want to 
                        call GitSync from some other place than the base 
                        directory of your git repository (i.e. the directory 
                        containing the subfolder ".git"). For example, if your 
                        repository is located in "/home/somebody/somefolder" 
                        (i.e. that folder contains the subfolder 
                        "/home/somebody/somefolder/.git" after invoking 
                        "git init", you may either place GitSync in 
                        "/home/somebody/somefolder" and call it from there, or 
                        set GIT_REP="/home/somebody/somefolder" to call the 
                        script from anywhere in your system.
